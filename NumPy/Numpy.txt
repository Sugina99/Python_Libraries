	NumPy is short for "Numerical Python"

NumPy Introduction
------------------
What is NumPy?
	NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
	It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
	NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
	NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

Why Use NumPy?
	In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
	NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
	The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.	
	Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?
	Will show the Live Demo on this topic.

Which Language is NumPy written in?
	NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.

Where is the NumPy Codebase?
	The source code for NumPy is located at this github repository https://github.com/numpy/numpy
	
Installation of NumPy
	pip install numpy

Import NumPy
	import numpy
	Now NumPy is imported and ready to use.
